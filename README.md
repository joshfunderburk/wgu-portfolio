# Josh Funderburk's WGU Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases the projects and assignments I've completed as part of the Master of Science in Data Analytics (MSDA) program at Western Governors University (WGU). Each project reflects my proficiency in various data analytics tools and methodologies.

Each directory in this repository represents a course and the files within contain projects completed as part of the course.

The degree was required 11 courses:

### D204: The Data Analytics Journey
Provides an overview of the entire analytics life cycle. Covers data analytics terminology, tools, and techniques within organizational contexts. Focuses on developing fluency in analytics, contextualizing the analytics journey, and creating project plans to solve organizational problems.


### D205: Data Acquisition
Builds proficiency in Structured Query Language (SQL) and relational databases. Introduces data transference, database manipulation, and assessment of data dimensions, quality, and limitations. Develops skills in performing table operations and queries for analysis.


### D206: Data Cleaning
Focuses on data preparation skills including exploring, transforming, and imputing data as well as handling outliers. Develops code writing abilities for data manipulation, structure, and cleaning to reduce features in data sets in preparation for analysis.
